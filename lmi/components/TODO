For every component:
- is name set?
- are appropriate lru_cache decorators set?
- are slots enabled?

textbox, button, select should be focusable

additional components:
- Option
- ComboBox
- Menu (which can have submenus)



The computer is one big composite tool
The computer should not be responsible for displaying the tools
Agents can focus on it like they'd focus on any other tool
Maybe also use pix2struct for some experimental computers
The virtual world will have phones, desktops, laptops, buildings, social media, etc.
Don't use a DIY social media. Use the real deal. Discord / Twitter / Reddit
